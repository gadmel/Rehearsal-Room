## This project is a capstone project which I invented during the Web Development Bootcamp in March 2020. You may look at a proper working version of it [here](https://rehearsal-room.firebaseapp.com/). Kindly ask you not to delete first two brave members of a friendly rehearsal bunker. They are here for demonstration reasons.

### For correct work in development mode you will need **.env**, **.credentials.json** and **credentials.json**, which I do not publish. If you're looking for a **Junior Web Developer to hire** and you want to try my code out, please send me an <a href="mailto:abramov.gleb@gmail.com">E-Mail</a> so I will share these files with you under a gentlemen agreement not to misuse my senstive data.

### This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), utilizes some [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) features, like a real-time database (collection), server deployment, integrates a [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) UI test (adding a new member to the database) and gathers its components in a [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/). The CSS styling is realised through [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/).
